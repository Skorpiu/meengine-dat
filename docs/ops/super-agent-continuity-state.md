# Super Agent Continuity State

**Purpose:** conversation-independent DAT knowledge continuity and operational recovery.

**Snapshot date:** 2026-08-06

**Validity rule:** this snapshot is valid at the Git commit containing it. Resolve live branch and HEAD through Git; do not treat historical SHA values as eternal current state.

## Recovery Startup Procedure

Run read-only commands first:

```bash
git status --short --branch
git branch --show-current
git rev-parse HEAD
git rev-parse refs/remotes/origin/main
git log --oneline --decorate -12
```

Then read, in this order:

1. `.cursor/rules/architect-mode.mdc`
2. `docs/ops/super-agent-continuity-state.md`
3. `docs/architecture/current-state.md`
4. `docs/architecture/roadmap-todo.md`
5. `docs/architecture/engineering-excellence-audit-v1.md`
6. applicable decisions, system design, reviewer workflow, operating model, and runbooks

Stop before consequential work if Git state or canonical documents disagree.

## Current verified repository state

- Active branch at snapshot creation: `engineering-excellence-audit-v1`
- Previous continuity checkpoint: `ee8259d6ba76fdf45f931b1eff3f544a7e113716`
- `origin/main` baseline: `da5aea6fe4150e86d5bf568bb56b26dd53f7abeb`
- Branch purpose: P1 analysis-only engineering-excellence audit
- Branch publication: not pushed at snapshot creation
- Runtime/schema/data changes in audit branch: none
- Hosted/database/production writes in audit branch: none

## Runtime baseline

- Runtime migration application merge: `909b69a559d85ec6d5f319c75e0d6c04bf790da1`
- Runtime closure record: `a3970549da93108522e8805e3c4bd8923a059afb`
- Main after closure integration: `da5aea6fe4150e86d5bf568bb56b26dd53f7abeb`
- Required runtime: Node `24.x`
- Verified portable Node: `$HOME/.dat-toolchains/node-v24.18.0-win-x64/node.exe`
- Canonical validation: `pnpm -C driving_school_platform/nextjs_space check`

## Super Agent role

- Repository-aware DAT operational worker
- Investigates code and call paths
- Prepares guarded commands
- Maintains canonical documentation and continuity
- Proposes smallest-safe slices
- Does not autonomously approve push, merge, deletion, hosted mutation, database mutation, production mutation, destructive work, or behavioural scope expansion

## Governance status

| ID | Status | Summary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SA-GOV-001` | Confirmed and fixed | Semantic gates prove exact propositions and distinguish context, negation, history, and untracked evidence |
| `SA-GOV-002` | APTO | Authority hierarchy and conflict precedence are explicit |
| `SA-GOV-003` | APTO | Canonical Merge readiness criteria are the operational Definition of Done |
| `SA-GOV-004` | Confirmed and fixed | Proportional multidimensional Engineering Quality Review is mandatory |

## Confirmed code findings

| ID | Status | Summary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `UI-ORCH-001` | Confirmed; not implemented | Student edit can commit Student before linked User update fails |
| `API-ATOM-001` | Confirmed; not implemented | Generic user update commits User before Student/Instructor role-specific update |
| `UI-ORCH-002` | Confirmed; not implemented | Instructor profile/licence and qualified-category updates are separate writes |
| `UI-STRUCT-001` | Confirmed; deferred | People managers concentrate multiple workflows and local reconciliation states without direct component tests |

## Approved implementation direction

1. `student-profile-atomic-update-v1`
   - aggregate-specific transactional service;
   - existing `PATCH /api/admin/students/[id]` contract;
   - Student plus linked User all-or-nothing;
   - preserve authorization, tenant, demo, email, DTO, error, and audit contracts.

2. `instructor-profile-atomic-update-v1`
   - aggregate-specific transactional service;
   - existing `PATCH /api/admin/instructors/[id]` contract;
   - User profile, instructor licence, and qualified categories all-or-nothing;
   - preserve authorization, tenant, demo, email, DTO, error, and audit contracts.

3. `generic-user-update-contract-narrowing-v1`
   - execute only after Student and Instructor callers migrate;
   - remove aggregate-specific Student/Instructor responsibilities;
   - preserve any legitimate generic-user callers.

No implementation belongs in the current analysis branch.

## Required future regression evidence

- all-or-nothing behavior under injected second-write failure;
- tenant and role rejection;
- public-demo mutation rejection;
- unchanged dedicated email flows;
- audit behavior preserved or explicitly approved;
- Student-only/manual-record updates remain valid;
- instructor category and licence validation;
- client success and server failure behavior;
- no stale overlays or misleading complete-success messages;
- canonical Node 24 validation.

## Deferred structural To-Do

- Execute only after the three approved atomicity and generic-contract slices.
- Evaluate Student and Instructor orchestration separately.
- Add direct regression coverage around the remaining orchestration.
- Do not create a generic shared People manager from the current evidence.
- Accessibility and performance remain unclassified.

## Preserved unrelated branch

- Branch: `production-smoke-module-structure-audit-record-v1`
- Commit: `a4bea9dfcfb3407acd952c9a383e1fdf2c4d0e60`
- State: inspected only
- Do not merge, cherry-pick, copy, delete, or modify until separately justified.

## Current next action

Continue the engineering-excellence audit read-only with targeted accessibility and performance inspection. Preserve the three atomicity/contract slices as the first implementation sequence and `UI-STRUCT-001` as the deferred structural To-Do; no runtime implementation is authorized in the audit branch.

## Continuity update obligation

After every material phase, update this file and all affected canonical documents in the same checkpoint, then perform the Recovery Reconstruction Drill.

## Recovery Reconstruction Drill

A fresh SA session must be able to state from committed repository evidence:

- active branch and purpose;
- current main and runtime baseline;
- all confirmed findings and their statuses;
- approved implementation order;
- prohibited actions;
- exact next step;
- canonical validation command;
- relevant recovery and rollback expectations.
